# Deep learning models implementation

## Description

This repository features implementations of different deep learning models using PyTorch. Bellow is a brief explanation of each project:

- FFN-MNIST: implementation of a **feedforward neural network** to recognise the hand written digits of the MNIST dataset.
- CNN-CIFAR-10: implementation of a **convolutional neural network** to correctly label the images of the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- RNN-CNN-FNN-Leaf-Classification: implementation of a **recurrent neural network** as well as a CNN and FNN to correclty classify leaves based on different features.

## Built With

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)

## Credits

The code is partially based on https://github.com/DeepLearningDTU (Deep Learning course DTU).
